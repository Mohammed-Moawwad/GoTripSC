"In closing, GoTrip demonstrates how great travel applications come together—with thoughtful design, smart architecture, and reliable technology. I've shared with you the three pillars of this project: a unified, consistent interface that's simple to use; REST APIs that securely connect frontend to backend; and a database that organizes data efficiently.

Through building GoTrip, I've learned not just how to code, but how to think like an engineer—designing for users, building for scale, and solving problems systematically. The journey doesn't end here. With planned mobile apps, advanced features, and payment integration coming next, I'm excited about what's possible.

Thank you for your attention. Questions?"
