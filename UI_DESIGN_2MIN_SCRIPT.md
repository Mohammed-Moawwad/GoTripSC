### Introduction (10 seconds)

"GoTrip's design is built on three core principles that make it different from other travel booking platforms. These principles guide every design decision we made."

---

### 1. Unified Interface (20 seconds)

"**Unified Interface** means everything is in one place. Instead of using separate websites for hotels, flights, and buses, users do **everything on GoTrip**. They have **one login**, **one dashboard**, and **all bookings visible together**.

Think about it: normally you'd go to Booking.com for hotels, then Skyscanner for flights, then a bus company website. That's three different websites, three logins, three interfaces. With GoTrip, it's all seamless in one application."

---

### 2. Consistent Design (20 seconds)

"**Consistent Design** means the same patterns repeat everywhere. **Blue buttons** always mean primary actions. **Pink buttons** always highlight important tasks. **Card layouts** look the same whether you're booking a hotel or a flight.

Users learn patterns once and use them everywhere. If they know how to book a hotel, they instinctively understand how to book a flight because the design is consistent. No confusion, no relearning."

---

### 3. Simple Booking (10 seconds)

"**Simple Booking** means the process is straightforward. Clear forms with conversational labels, helpful error messages, and real-time feedback. Users complete bookings faster because nothing confuses them. The interface stays out of the way and lets users focus on their travel."

---

### Closing (5 seconds)

"These three principles—**unified, consistent, and simple**—come together to create an intuitive travel booking experience."
