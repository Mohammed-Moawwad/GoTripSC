## [SLIDE: Three Technical Things I Learned]

**[Total Time: 1 minute]**

---

"After building GoTrip and working through the entire development process, I learned three essential technical skills and knowledge that form the foundation of modern web applications. First, we gained a deep understanding of **REST API and how frontend and backend communicate** — . Second, we learned about **relational databases like MySQL** — how to organize data into connected tables that prevent duplication and keep information reliable and scalable. Third, we discovered **how Node.js and Express work as a server** — listening to requests, validating data, protecting the database, and sending responses back to the frontend.
